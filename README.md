RustyCompressor is a server application built in Rust, designed for handling file upload, and performing compression and decompression tasks. It leverages the power of frameworks like Actix or Rocket to set up HTTP routes efficiently. The server initializes by loading configurations from a dedicated config module and listens on a specified port for incoming requests. This project focuses on robust error handling during initialization and ensures a clear logging mechanism to confirm server startup. RustyCompressor aims to offer a reliable file processing service with an emphasis on simplicity and performance.
